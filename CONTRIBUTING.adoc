= HiveMQ Community Contributing Guidelines

== Introduction

Anyone is welcome to participate and contribute to the HiveMQ open source community. We encourage people to use the Github issue tracker and create pull requests.

We ask that contributions are focused on improving the current implementation and project scope.

We will not accept contributions that would add features that expand the scope of the project. It is HiveMQâ€™s intention to offer commercial products that will add features suited for enterprise deployments of HiveMQ. If you would like to suggest a new feature, please contact the project team (support@hivemq.com) to discuss if it fits within the project scope. If you wish to contribute, we will preferibly accept Bug Fixes, Typos, Documentation, JavaDoc and Logging.

== Licensing

HiveMQ Open Source Projects are released under the Apache 2.0 license to allow you the use of the software as you please. By contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Please fill out our Contributor License Agreement (CLA), otherwise we cannot accept your contribution.

All files must contain the license header from the link:HEADER[header file].

== Contributor License Agreement
If you wish to contribute to the HiveMQ CE, please download, fill out and sign the https://www.hivemq.com/downloads/Contributor_License_Agreement.pdf[Contributor License Agreement]. Send the signed agreement  to (contributing@hivemq.com) with the subject `CLA for Project: <Project Name>`. Please read this document carefully before signing it and keep a copy for your own records. Once we've received your signed CLA, you will be added to the list of contributors and our HiveMQ Development Team will review your contributions.

In case the rights to all intellectual property created by you are maintained by your employer, including your work on HiveMQ Open Source Projects, you must ensure you have retained all rights to grant the license, or that your employer has agreed to a separate https://www.hivemq.com/downloads/Corporate_Contributor_License_Agreement.pdf[Corporate CLA].

== Contribution Guidelines

=== Issues
==== Bug Fixes and Minor Features

Please always open an issue in the issue tracker before sending a pull request and wait until someone from the HiveMQ Development Team approves it, before you start working on it. This prevents you from working on issues that we will ultimately not accept. When you start working on an approved issue, please make it known in the comments that you are going to work on it, so a simultaneous contribution by someone else can be avoided.

After you committed, your contribution will be reviewed by the HiveMQ Development Team. We reserve the right to release only reviewed and approved implementations.

==== Security Issues
Please do not report any security issue to the public issue tracker. Please send security issues to security@hivemq.com.

==== Questions

Please refer all your questions about the HiveMQ Open Source Projects to the https://community.hivemq.com[HiveMQ Community Forum].

Issues consisting of questions or suggestions will be closed immediately.

=== Code Style Guidelines
Only code following _good_ Java practices, like using the appropriate keywords and visibility, will be accepted.

HiveMQ CE uses nullability annotations, these should be used to annotate the declared types of variables and fields, whose initialization status can be in question.

.Nullability example
[source,java]
----
class SomeClass {

    // this must never be null, the accessor can depend on it
    private @NotNull SomeType myField;

    // this may be null, the accessor must check
    private @Nullable SomeType anotherField;

}
----

Four annotations are provided for this purpose, two for each type:

.@Nullable
----
com.hivemq.annotations.Nullable
com.hivemq.extension.sdk.api.annotations.Nullable
----

.@NotNull
----
com.hivemq.annotations.NotNull
com.hivemq.extension.sdk.api.annotations.NotNull
----

=== Commit Guidelines

You can set up IntelliJ to recognise these annotations under `Preferences > Inspections > @NotNull/@Nullable problems > Configure annotations`.

Please watch out for this inspection and check the _Reformat code_, _Optimize imports_ and _Perform code analysis_ checkboxes in the commit dialogue.

=== Testing

The HiveMQ Open Source projects only accept pull requests that contain unit tests and have sufficient unit test coverage.

=== Pull Requests

As soon as your code is ready for a https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request[pull request], please link the specific issue that you want to resolve. Once the continuous integration is successful and at least one member of the HiveMQ Development Team has approved the changes, you will be asked to rebase and squash before the pull request can be merged.

We greatly appreciate your involvement and contribution.
